Hello again!
I suppose it's time for introductions, I guess...

My name is REDACTED, I suppose.
This is my website, I think.

As of me writing this, I am a 16 year old Junior in REDACTED High School.
The only sport I do is Fencing, which I think I'm pretty decent at but I don't actually know cause I have never tried competitive. 
My favorite book is "The Count of Monte Cristo" by Alexandre Dumas.
I have had perfect attendance since 6th grade.  I have been to most of the 50 states, Portugal, Spain, France, England, Italy, Israel, and The Philippines. I'm also a huge fan of TYPE-MOON (even though I haven't even seen like 1/4 of it).
