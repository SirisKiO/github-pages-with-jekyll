Hello again!
I suppose it's time for introductions, I guess...

My name is REDACTED, I suppose.
This is my website, I think.

As of me writing this on the Fourteenth of May, 2021, I am a Junior in REDACTED High School.
The only sport I do is Fencing, which I think I'm pretty decent at but I don't actually know cause I have never tried competitive. 
My favorite book is "The Count of Monte Cristo" by Alexandre Dumas.
I am a huge fan of TYPE-MOON.
